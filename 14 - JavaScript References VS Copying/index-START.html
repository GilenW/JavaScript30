    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age,age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age,age2);//age2 is a copy of the original value

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players,team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';//in this case, team points to orginal array so it change the original value

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'helllllooo';
    console.log(team4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 100; //this also changes the orginal value, because it is not a copy but a pointer
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person, {number:99})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age:100,
      social:{
        twitter:'@wesbos',
        facebook:'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);
    const dev = Object.assign({},wes); // this is only a shallow copy,if you change the value of twiteer it can also change the original value, because it doesn't go deeper to the next level. We would need clone.deep

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
